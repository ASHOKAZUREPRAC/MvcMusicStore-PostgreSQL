MvcMusicStore-PostgreSQL
========================

This project updates the original ASP.NET MVC Music Store to run on PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Code First. 

To run this project, you will need to
1) Create the MvcMusicStore database in your postgreSQL server and run the MvcMusicStore-Create-PostgreSQL.sql to create the tables and insert sample data.
2) Update the web.config connection string to point to your postgreSQL server.
